bug: reseting slope to default is problematic.
bug: when I select rev0 station tracks, corner offset changes.

- options for default universal behaviours:
    - auto embankment for curved segments.


- open and close left and right table.
- new Corner table organisation

- test selecting nodes on top of another road (FRT + anarchy + moveIT). (can't reproduce)

- corner offset to increase chances of train track connection.
- fix the orientation of asym road
- support for asymetric textures
- lod support (not now)

- Toggle Crossing tool mod activatble from UUI.
